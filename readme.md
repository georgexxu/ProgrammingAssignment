This repository contains code for the programming assignment for the summer lectures by Prof. Jinchao Xu at CIRM, Marseille, France, July 18th 2023. 

Three examples are covered.
1. Gradient descent for a 3 by 3 system, and a 4 by 4 system.
2. Training ReLU shallow neural networks using the gradient descent method for 1D L^2 fitting tasks.
3. Training ReLU shallow neural networks using an orthogonal greedy algorithm for 1D L^2 fitting tasks.
