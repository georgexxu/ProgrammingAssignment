This repository contains code for the programming assignment for the summer lectures by Prof. Jinchao Xu at CIRM, Marseille, France, July 18th 2023. 

Three examples are covered.
1. Gradient descent for a 3 by 3 system, and a 4 by 4 system. (GD4expandedSystem.ipynb)
2. Use the gradient descent method to training ReLU shallow neural networks for 1D $L^2$ fitting tasks. (L2Fitting1D_GD.ipynb)
3. Use an orthogonal greedy algorithm to train ReLU shallow neural networks for 1D $L^2$ fitting tasks. (L2Fitting1D_OGA.ipynb)

The two other files code_explanation_gd.ipynb, code_explanation_oga.ipynb are the computer session materials that break down the code in L2Fitting1D_GD.ipynb, L2Fitting1D_OGA.ipynb into easily accessible parts for teaching purpose.
